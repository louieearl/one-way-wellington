## The Game
One Way Wellington is a 2D building/management game made in Unity. The goal is to transport as many creative passengers across the galaxy - to the coolest little capital on Earth.

Our home amongst the stars, the Milky Way is filled with life in every corner of the galaxy. Players will build their own spaceship and operate an interplanetary transport service, one-way to Wellington, Earth.

Start your journey by creating a route between planets of the galaxy. Collect as many creative passengers who want to call Wellington home.

Earn money after each journey and use it to upgrade your ship. Travel further and faster on future journeys with better engines and fuel tanks.

Every passenger is an artist from a wide selection of creative fields, including architects, filmmakers and video game developers. Some special passengers will be based on real-world local Wellington artists. By interviewing these artists, their story can be told by their in-game character. These special passengers will feature their own unique gameplay events and challenges. Perhaps an animation graduate, nervous of leaving home for the first time, is on board your ship during an engine failure – the ship becomes a sitting duck to enemy attacks.

While navigating the stars, enemies will try to board your ship. Different groups of enemies have their own motives for an attack. Some may intend to steal your ship or resources, while others attempt to capture your creative passengers for themselves.
